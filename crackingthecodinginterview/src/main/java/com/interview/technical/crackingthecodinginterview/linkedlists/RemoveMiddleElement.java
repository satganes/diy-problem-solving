 * Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but the
 * first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked
 * list, given only access to that node.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * EXAMPLE 
 * 
 * lnput:the node c from the linked list
 * a->b->c->d->e->f 
 * Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like 
 * a->b->d->e- >f
