 * 
 * An element in a sorted array can be found in O(log n) time via binary search.
 * But suppose we rotate an ascending order sorted array at some pivot unknown
 * to you beforehand. So for instance, 1 2 3 4 5 might become 3 4 5 1 2. Devise
 * a way to find an element in the rotated array in O(log n) time.
