# String Problems And their implementations

* UniqueCharactersInAString - 
	Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
	cannot use additional data structures?

* Check Permutation - 
	Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the
	other.?
	
* URLify  - 
	Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string
	has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
	length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can
	perform this operation in place.)
	
* OneAway  - 
	One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
	remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
	one edit (or zero edits) away.
	EXAMPLE
	pale, ple -> true
	pales, pale -> true
	pale, bale -> true
	pale, bake -> false

* StringCompression  - 
	Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts
	of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the
	"compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return
	the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).

* RotateMatrix  - 
	Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4
	bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

* ZeroMatrix  - 
	Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and
	column are set to 0.
